## Install
```VimL
Plug 'danishprakash/vim-yami'
```

## Usage
```VimL
colorscheme yami
```

## Note
For Yami to work, you Vim installation should support `termguicolors`. Neovim and Vim (> 7.4.1799) should work as expected. However, if you face any issues, feel free to create an issue and/or a pull request.
